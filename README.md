# Architecture:
CloudNotes employs a serverless architecture using AWS services. The React frontend communicates with AWS Amplify for authentication and API interactions. API Gateway facilitates secure communication between the frontend and backend, while user notes are stored in DynamoDB. Lambda functions handle backend logic, ensuring seamless note creation, retrieval, and deletion. Cognito adds robust user authentication, contributing to a scalable, resilient, and efficient cloud-based note-taking experience.
